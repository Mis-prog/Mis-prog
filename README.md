## Hello everyone, my name is Misha ðŸ‘‹
I studied at Ufa State Aviation Technical University in the specialty "Applied Mathematics" from 2021 to 2025 (Bachelor's degree).

I am interested in machine learning, computer vision, 3D reconstruction and restoration of camera parameters (camera calibration)

Academic projects from the university
- [Laboratory work for the 7th semester on mathematical modeling](https://github.com/Mis-prog/matmod/)
- [Laboratory work for the 8th semester on mathematical modeling](https://github.com/Mis-prog/matmod-8sem/)
- [Implementation of optimization methods for selecting RBF interpolation parameters](https://github.com/Mis-prog/kursovai_5sem)
- [Signal Processing App](https://github.com/Mis-prog/digital-signal-processing-app)

Currently, I am working on a camera calibration project for traffic scene analysis. The goal is to recover the cameraâ€™s intrinsic and extrinsic parameters using vanishing points, road geometry, and satellite data.
I'm open to collaboration and eager to contribute to applied computer vision projects.
